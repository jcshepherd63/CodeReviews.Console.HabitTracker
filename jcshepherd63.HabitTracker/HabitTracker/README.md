Console Habit Tracker Application
-----------------------------------

This application used C# and SQLite with ADO.NET to perform CRUD operations on 2 tables. One table is used to track pushups and the other is used to track situps.

What was hard? 

The ADO.NET connection was difficult as it was my first time connecting to a database in C#. I added a second table to try to more fully solidify memory of the steps needed to set up CRUD operations. With that being said, I am still worried that I will forget going forward.

What was easy? 

The creation of the different menus was easy. I have a decent amount of experience within the C# console now, so I feel comfortable making changes and formatting information within the console. 

What have I learned? 

I learned that overall architecture is going to be a struggle for me in the future. I can understand syntax, formatting, and the logic behind methods, but I struggle to understand the purpose behind some of the C# architecture such as a library. 
I definitely feel more confident looking over C# documentation from Microsoft after this project; however, I could use more practice in that realm as well.
